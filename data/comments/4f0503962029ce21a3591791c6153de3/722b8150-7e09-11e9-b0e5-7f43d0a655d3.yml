This means that you have 24/7 access to your funds to purchase goods, transfer to others, lend others, convert to fiat currency and more.\r\n\r\nIn case of a sudden recession in your country, you are protected from banks closing, offering limited withdrawals or simply not having your funds accessible. The Amen Mobile Wallet means you have complete control over your money, at all times.\r\n\r\nhttp://amendollar.io - Read More"
