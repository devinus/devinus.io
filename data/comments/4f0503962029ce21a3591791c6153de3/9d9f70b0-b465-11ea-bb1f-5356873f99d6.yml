content: "Wa mourners reflect on tsunami lessons from tsunami survivor, after he was named winner of Britain's'most inspirational' award\n\nOne of his co-founders was John Beadle, whose family owns a building materials firm, as well as serving as a mentor to the man known as 'the bomb'.\n\nA former engineer who also created the famous Londonderry-based 'Boat of Death', Mr Beadle's son, David, the director of the New South Wales Civil Defence Agency, had warned he was under pressure to move his family out of the village because of a housing crunch.\n\nToday David, who has taken a job in the construction industry as a contractor and has become a national celebrity, said his father had been suffering from depression at the time of the tsunami, when he took him to the local hospital for treatment.\n\nHe said: \"It was devastating: the building site had collapsed, everything was damaged, the electricity, water, gas was running out and nothing anyone could do was being done. So when he was there, he was pretty upset because my dad was a very strong guy.\n\n\"In my mind he was still fighting through a terrible feeling that he was being blamed for something very bad happening.\n\n\"But in a big group of people that could have been someone from the community. And the community wasn't there to deal with what was going on and that's what caused his depression so he just stayed there and he lost his mind.\n\n\"A group of people was there, he wasn't there with them. He didn't speak to them for weeks and it became a huge problem for us, we couldn't go into it in the public eye, I think we were all quite shocked.\n\n\"It was his father's choice not to attend and it's an awful thing to happen â€“ when you have someone there like a father, when you're able to walk away and not be held responsible for something.\"\n\nMr Beadle died after the magnitude 9.1 magnitude hit about 40 minutes from his home in the village of Rangatala, on the New South Wales coast, on August 7 1995, killing all 13 of his children and their mother, his wife and two sons.\n\nThe death of the father is described by an official as a \"tetradiaphoric event with the devastating impact of a magnitude 9.1\". The official, who is known to many as the Londonderry Disaster Prevention officer, said the official's experience could have saved many lives.\n\nWhen asked how he could stand by with such grief, David replied: \"I was doing absolutely nothing to cope, I was just just looking around and thinking: 'what am I going to do?'\n \r\n<a href=https://www.shamsbim.com/>온카지노</a>\r\n<a href=https://www.grupo-huk.com/>온카지노</a>\r\n \r\nAustralian journalist peter greste will be charged on Monday after spending the evening on Facebook claiming he was being attacked in Bristol by a man wearing a mask, according to police.\n\nPreste posted on his Facebook page on Friday afternoon, saying: \"Just woke up to have a face to face confrontation at Bristol's Bristol Arena tonight. Police were called and we were told that a man who looked like a black hooded cape was attacking me. A police officer was called, who then said that it was a prank.\"\n\nPolice responded to the stadium and said the officer could not locate him.\n\nPolice have not released his face, but it is understood the police officer did contact a member of the public who could provide him with photos of the suspect.\n\nIt is unclear whether police have asked people to post pictures or if it was merely done for the purpose of identification.\n\nPreste, 31, from Bristol, said: \"I have no idea why they're here, it wasn't like someone had walked up to me saying 'hey, who'd you see coming up from behind to a fight' - it's just been a weird event.\"\n\nHe later posted on his page: \"This is not a joke. I'm really really sorry. I am very sorry. I've not put on a mask or any kind of disguise for these two, I would normally be laughing off the whole thing, but this seems to be a real case of a bit of fun.\"\n\nHe added: \"A few things that people who've been in Bristol for quite some time may know about me: I go to Bristol's Black Sheep (a club in the centre of the city) and the same time every evening before the match I will sit down to a beer with the football club's fans and drink, get drunk, and then go to bed before I go out into the city again.\"\n\nPreste said he was given alcohol by a staff member at the venue, which serves beer and wine, before the encounter.\n\nHe added: \"It is very sad and a bit sad. I would usually get off at around 8.30, go home and get to work on time, but I wasn't. I got caught up. My head felt very uncomfortable, it was pretty awkward for me at that time. I just thought to myself 'I can't drink anymore'.\n\n\"I didn't put any sort of face on, nothing. That's the last thing I would have done at this point. I'm probably not as safe at night as I would like to be, and then have all these strange events. There's always a chance of people in my group who like to be around me attacking me in a way that they're definitely going to take advantage o"
