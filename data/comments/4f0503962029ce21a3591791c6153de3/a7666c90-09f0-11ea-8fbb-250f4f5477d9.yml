content: "My name is Jana. And I am a professional academic writer with many years of experience in writing. \r\n \r\nMy goal is to solve problems related to writing. And I have been doing it for many years. I have been with several groups as a volunteer and have assisted clients in many ways. \r\nMy love for writing has no end. It is like the air we breathe, something I cherish with all my being. I am a passionate writer who started at an early age. \r\nI’m happy that I`ve already sold several copies of my poems in different countries like Canada and China and others too numerous to mention. \r\nI also work in an organization that provides assistance to many students from different parts of the world. People always come to me because I work no matter how complex their projects are. I help them to save money, because I feel happy when people come to me for writing help. \r\n \r\nGhost Writer – Jana Woods - <a href=https://sonicrec.com/>Sonicrec</a> Confederation"
