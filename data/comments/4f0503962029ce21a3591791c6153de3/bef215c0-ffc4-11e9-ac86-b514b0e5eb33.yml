content: "Thanks for stopping by my page! I’m Jana. \r\nEven though I jokingly credit my  grandmother  for my writing talent, I know that it is a  talent  I have fostered from childhood. Though my  grandmother  is a writer, I also started out young. \r\nI’ve always had a way with words, according to my favorite  educator. I was always so excited in  history  when we had to do a research  writing assignment. \r\nNow, I help current  pupils achieve the grades that have always come easily to me. It is my way of giving back to  students because I understand the troubles they must overcome to graduate. \r\n \r\nJana – Academic Writer  – <a href=https://www.myessaypartner.com/>Myessaypartner</a> Team"
