The Colts have exclusive rights on first-round draft pick Phillip Dorsett through 2019, and 6-foot-5 Duron Carter is entering the first year of his <a href=http://www.cheapwholesalejerseysstore.us.com/>Cheap Authentic Jerseys Online</a> NFL deal, too. Carter spent the last two seasons in the <a href=http://www.cheapjerseysstitchedchina.com/>Wholesale China Jerseys</a> CFL. That means the receiving corps could remain the same for three straight years.\r\n\"We come to <a href=http://www.outletairmaxitalia.it/>Air Max Outlet Online Italia</a> work every single day and <a href=http://www.buffalobillsshoponline.com/>Wholesale Buffalo Bills Jerseys</a> we put the hours <a href=http://www.baseballworldclassic.com/>WBC Jerseys 2017</a> in,\" linebacker NaVorro Bowman said. \"It's not like we're sitting on our behinds.\"\r\nThat fits right into Fox's philosophy.\r\nHOUSTON (AP) é”Ÿ?Texans running back Arian Foster is out for the season with an Achilles <a href=http://www.cheapstansmithonline.com/>Adidas Stan Smith Wholesale</a> tendon injury, a significant blow for a team that was just blown out for the second time this season.\r\nWhitney Mercilus had a career-high 3 1/2 sacks and J.J. Watt tied a career high with nine quarterback hits and added 2 1/2 sacks, including one where he caused a fumble that the Texans recovered early in the fourth quarter."
