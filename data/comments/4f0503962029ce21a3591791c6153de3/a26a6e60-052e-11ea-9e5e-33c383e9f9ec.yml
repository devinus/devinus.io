content: "New coach Todd Bowles recently said the team would like to add another player to the quarterback mix for new offensive coordinator Chan Gailey's system that includes Smith, Fitzpatrick and Matt Simms. New York could focus on another quarterback in free agency, or opt to draft one, namely Oregon's Marcus Mariota, with the No. 6 pick.\r\n\"I thought it was going to be a touchdown,\" Wilson said. \"But I put the blame on me. I'm the one who threw it.\"\r\n\"They're using me how they need me right now,\" Cook said. \"I just sit in the holster and wait until they're ready to use me. I'm like a soldier and <a href=http://www.discountjerseyscheap.com/>Wholesale Jerseys Free Shipping</a> <a href=http://www.wholesalejerseysforsale.us.com/>Stitched Jerseys Outlet</a> you do what they ask you to do. So yeah, I'm blocking more. It's part of the game. It's just how the season's gone.\"\r\n\"Oh, man,\" Bryant said. \"It seems like a year.\"\r\nActually, the defense had been <a href=http://www.swellbottlesclearance.com/>Cheap SWell Bottle</a> playing well even before Rodgers <a href=http://www.wholesale95airmax.com/>Nike Air Max 95 Wholesale China</a> got hurt. Coordinator Dom Capers' crew has tightened up against the run since <a href=http://www.cheapoutletjerseys.com/>Cheap NFL Jerseys China</a> the middle of the season, in part because the Packers are using Clay Matthews and Sam Barrington more at inside linebacker to add athleticism."
