content: "I think everything published was actually \r\nvery logical. However, what about this? suppose you added a little information? I am not saying your information is not good., but \r\nsuppose you added a title that grabbed folk's attention? I mean A \r\nTransliterating URL Slugifier in Erlang ~ Devin Alexander Torres is kinda boring.\r\n\r\nYou could peek at Yahoo's home page and see how they create news headlines to get \r\npeople to open the links. You might try adding a video or a related pic or two \r\nto grab readers interested about what you've got to say.\r\nIn my opinion, it could make your posts a little bit more interesting."
