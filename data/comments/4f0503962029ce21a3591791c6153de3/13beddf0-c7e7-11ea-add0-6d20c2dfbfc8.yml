The wujal and their council will make an annual parade wljal wujal and this year is in honour of the centenary of the birth of Captain Alfred John Ainsworth who died in 1917. We hope our parade will not be overshadowed by other events or the fact that there will be a larger parade the year prior. In addition to a march from The Junction to the Parade Ground we have planned for the first time a community reception and a memorial service at The Junction on the occasion of the centenary of the birth of Captain Alfred John Ainsworth (1803-1897). We hope our community will make this event a special day for those who are proud to be of Anzac birth or who will be remembering Captain Alfred Ainsworth. It will be made even more special by the fact that the next parade will be on April 23rd and that a week prior the centenary will be celebrated with the second and final Anzac Day parade and the first parade for the centenary. We will also be offering a special Anzac Day service at The Junction on the day of the centenary of the birth of Captain Alfred Ainsworth, the day he died in 1802. Please register your interest now before our date runs out. (10/02)\n\nI have always felt Anzac Day celebrations should be carried out on Anzac Day. In fact, the First World War has been used as a convenient model in many recent events. It gives Australians a sense of pride and belonging to a great nation. The way it is carried out by the Centenary Commission, for example, has been brilliant, making Anzac Day just one of many important things that happen on this occasion. To do this, however, is to give Australian history a bad name. There are many things, including the Royal Wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, that are important to Australians. However, this centenary of Anzac Day should not be seen as some kind of battle between a Great War veteran and his Royal Highness. This is an event whose purpose is to remember those who lost their lives in WW1 and those who gave their lives to their country. This is the time of year when our nation commemorates both those who gave and those who died during war. The Australian people, the Prime Minister, the Commonwealth and the federal government should stand together in celebrating this great event. A centenary day for Anzac Day cannot be an isolated holiday, for this very reason. This has nothing whatsoever to do with the historical importance of Anzac Day, nor with the celebration of those individuals who fought or died during WW1. Such a celebration must be built on the strong foundation of the Great War and a rea \r\n<a href=https://www.cashmudra.com/>카지노</a>\r\n \r\nGawler mayor brian sambell says the community will be held accountable for what they've done,\" the statement said. \r\n<a href=https://www.grupo-huk.com/>온카지노</a>"
