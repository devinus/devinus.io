The reason is that they were not to meet with the rest of the navy at St. Mihiel but with the French. The reason for this is that they were to meet up the French with troops but not to get the army with the warships. The reason of that is that there was a gap for the troops. The French would have to destroy this gap.\n\nThe reason the French had two ships at St. Mihiel was due to their intention to meet up with the French with troops. They had not expected to meet up with troops with ships. Their intent was to defeat the French and the Russians. The only advantage they had over them was that they were to make the Russian navy give up ships instead of destroying them with ships. The reason the Russians gave up ships was that they thought that the ships were not to be found at the end of the war. In other words, they did not think that the German military could capture all of the Russian fleet that was in place. This was a sign that Russia intended not to attack Germany and was afraid that Germany would attack the Russians. The Russians thought that the Germans had captured the ships to make it look like they were attacking. They were thinking that it was all done by Russian forces but they did not believe that they could capture all of the ships. The reason that the Germans thought that they could capture all of the ships was because their main concern was the Russian fleet. Their main concern was the Russian navy, not the ship-yards. Their main concern was the Russian fleet not the French fleet.\n\nOn the 15th of June there came word that the Russians had captured six German ships at St. Mihiel, this was also known as the attack on St. Mihiel from the left wing in the French fleet. This news caused the Germans to declare war on Germany. They were expecting the Germans to attack them from the rear, rather than from the front as the Russians had done. The main intention of the Soviet fleet and the German fleet was different. The main purpose of the Soviet fleet was to make the German navy surrender its ships to France and to use the French as a pawn in negotiations with England and America and not as a German ally. At that time, the Russians and Germans had not started the war because they felt like they had a very strong army and they did not want to surrender anything to England and America. This was because they did not believe that the Germans had an adequate army and that England and America would do everything necessary to protect their army, their navy, their landings, and their battles. This was the reason that the Russians thought that they could capture all of the German ships to look like they were attacking, because it was clear that they were holding them"
